                                        Effective policymaking relies on accurate and consistent data. Many social issues‚Äîsuch as violence against women, sex-based discrimination, and health disparities‚Äîrequire statistics categorized by biological sex, not subjective gender identity. If legal systems allow individuals to self-identify their gender on official records, it may distort these datasets by mixing male and female patterns of behavior, crime, or health outcomes. This can make it harder to detect problems specific to women and girls, and ultimately weaken laws designed to protect them.

This was done to improve safety and maintain accurate data on sex-based crime statistics. Commentators warned that failing to differentiate by biological sex could hide male-perpetrated violence and misguide public policy.

                        <p class="mb-4">When the law forces people to accept a subjective gender identity, views based on science, philosophy, or religion that see biological sex as objective reality can be labeled as "discrimination." This creates a chilling effect, where people are afraid to express their true thoughts for fear of losing their jobs or being socially condemned, which violates basic freedom of speech and conscience.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-stone-700 mb-2">Tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job for tweeting that biological sex cannot be changed. A UK court ultimately ruled that her "gender-critical" beliefs are protected under the Equality Act. This case set an important legal precedent for protecting freedom of speech on different viewpoints.</p>

                In summary, opposing legal gender self-identification is not necessarily a rejection of personal identity, but a call for a cautious approach. These arguments center on the view that biological sex is an objective reality with tangible consequences for law, safety, fairness, and data. They highlight the potential negative impacts on the rights of women and children, medical accuracy, and fundamental freedoms, advocating for a more regulated system.
